   - Without network: Generate a mock list of questions.
* First app launch without network:
   - Return data from the database.
* App launch without network:
   - Return data from the database.
* App launch with network, with the last request within 5 minutes:
   - Return data from the database.
* App launch with network, with the last request over 5 minutes ago:
