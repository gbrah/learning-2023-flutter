## ðŸ“± Project: Creating a Flutter Application

Propose and develop an application of your choice in Flutter, with support for at least 2 platforms (e.g. Android and iOS).
You must have all your functionalities validated by the **MONTH , YEAR** session at the latest (if you don't, you risk going off-topic during the defense).
The list of functionalities must be detailed in a document/schema with priorities.

Your application should include the following technical elements:

1. Custom widgets based on material or cupertino
2. One or 2 animations
3. One or more calls to a REST API (e.g. OpenWeather, PokeAPI, etc.)
4. Local storage (e.g. SharedPreferences AND SQLite, etc.)

Your project presentation will take place on **MONTH , YEAR** and will last 15 minutes.
The project is to be carried out alone.

Your presentation will be based on a medium of your choice and should present :

1. A description of the initially chosen functionalities (originality and complexity will be taken into account) /5
2. A summary of what has been achieved, including a technical explanation and any difficulties encountered /5
   3. a demo of the application /5
3. A series of technical questions from the teacher /5
